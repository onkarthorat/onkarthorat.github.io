		<div class="content">

			<p style="text-align:justify">Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack is one of the most dangerous attacks that result in bringing down the server(s) and it is essential to classify the exact attack to implement robust security measures. In this work, we present an approach for detecting the prominent DDoS attacks that can be carried over Transport Layer protocols. Four different levels are taken into consideration which helps to classify one of the 11 different attacks. A bigger problem is divided into smaller ones and then conquered. This approach, called TaxoDaCML - Taxonomy-based Divide and Conquer approach using ML minimizes computational cost and at the same time maintains the required accuracy. Results prove that our approach achieves 99.9% accuracy for DDoS attack detection and more than 85% for DDoS attack classification. Comparison of TaxoDaCML is done with the previous works and is found to perform better for DDoS attacks classification.</p>

				<i>Title</i> - Domain adaptation and weight initialization of neural networks for diagnosing interstitial lung diseases<br>

		<div class="content">
			<p style="text-align:justify">Interstitial lung diseases (ILDs) are adverse disorders, damaging the lung tissues, thus making timely diagnosis imperative. To counter the scarcity of publicly available high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) data, architecture employing HRCT and x-ray data have been proposed for diagnosing ILDs. A model is first trained to diagnose three ILDs and a healthy lung from x-ray data and then with a small amount of HRCT data of the same four classes. We introduce an EfficientNet+AlexNet model and a custom deep convolutional neural network and compare their performances with different weight initialization at the start of x-ray image training. The EfficientNet+AlexNet model initialized with ImageNet weights performed best on the x-ray dataset and was later used for domain adaptation. We also compare our model's performance to a single pre-trained EfficientNetB0 model (trained on the same HRCT data). Our model gave an accuracy of 97.4% on the testing dataset, a notable increase in the performance compared to the recently proposed methodologies. The experimental results and graphical plots depict the superiority of domain adaptation and the potentials of weights that are a starting point for training the models.</p>

		<div class="content">
			<p style="text-align:justify">With MOOCs becoming an educational buzzword in India and presaging a revolution in education technology; companies such as Coursera, Udemy and EdX, that offer undergraduate-level university courses as alternatives to mainstream education are on the rise across India. The paper tries to impress upon the importance of modulation in content when a multitude of courses and tracks are presented to a user. The finding presents two unique insights, the first being, would a user be it a student or teacher go astray in exploring varied domains available in MOOCs? The second, would student enrollment leaning specifically towards particular courses point to a lacuna in the current course offerings at the university curriculum and could such courses be offered as electives under the mentorship of professors, considering a cluster demand for the same is clearly seen from the learning analytics.</p>

				<i>Title</i> - Combining DNA sequences and chaotic maps to improve robustness of RGB image encryption<br>
			<i>Authors</i> - Onkar Thorat, Ramchandra Mangrulkar<br>
			<i>Journal/Conference</i> - Accepted in the International Journal of Computational Science and Engineering, Inderscience Publishers
<br>
		<button type="button" class="collapsible"><i>Abstract</i></button>
		<div class="content">
			<p style="text-align:justify">In today's world color images are vastly generated and stored for a variety of purposes by organizations. Standard encryption schemes such as AES or DES are not well suited for encryption of multimedia data due to their pattern appearance and high computational cost. Many methods are being proposed for the encryption of grayscale images. However, there are only a few methods proposed in the literature specifically for encrypting the color images. This paper presents a new method called RGB Image Encryption Scheme (RGBIES) for encrypting the color images based on Chaotic maps and DNA sequences. RGBIES has three major stages. Stages 1 and 3 propose a powerful scrambling algorithm based on a Chaotic Logistic map. The intermediate step uses a Chaotic Lorenz map, the keys of which are obtained using DNA sequences. Various visual and quantitative analyses are performed that prove the resistance of the method against modern-day attacks.</p>

			<i>(Transformers (Hugging Face), GANs (PyTorch), spaCy, Python)</i>
			<ul>	
				<li>While the purpose of this project is to help children with cognitive disabilities grasp and learn better, it is equally useful to others. Have you ever wondered what it might be like to visually view the story you read?</li>
				<li>Vision Acolyte makes that possible with the use of Transformers and GANs. User needs to enter a textual story which then gets converted into a visualization. (Currently, the stories are limited to animated stories for children)</li>
				<li><i>My role - </i>Literature survey, devising the methodolgy, implementation and validation in Python.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Hand Gesture Recognition</h3>
			<i>(Keras with TensorFlow as backend, OpenCV, Python)</i>
			<ul>
			<li>The project aims to predict the five gestures shown by the user in real-time using a 5-layer custom-made CNN model.</li>
			<li>We made our own dataset and trained the model on this dataset. </li>
			<li><i>My role - </i>Collected the data using an OpenCV script, created and trained the model.</li>
