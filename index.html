		<h1>Projects
		</h1>
		<ol>
			<b><li>Vision Acolyte - BE Major Project (Currently working)</li></b>
			While the purpose of this project is to help children with cognitive disabilities grasp and learn better, it is equally useful to others. Have you ever wondered what it might be like to visually view the story you read? Vision Acolyte makes that possible with the use of Deep Learning models such as Transformers and GANs.
			<b><li>Hand Gesture Recognition model</li></b>
			This project predicts the number of fingers showed by the user in real-time. It applies Transfer Learning using ResNet50 model on a custom made dataset for classification. Various other Computer Vision algorithms are also employed in this project. The project can be found <a href = "https://github.com/onkarthorat/Hand-Gesture-Recognition-Model" target="blank">here</a>.
			<b><li>Autograder - Creating Classification of Models</li></b>
			A project completed under the guidance of IBM mentors to ease the work of faculty members. A Deep Learning Model that helps in autograding of the students' answers by comparing it with the base answer. The model also provides a grade on a range of 0-5. Moreover, the model is integrated on a website made using Django as backend.
			<b><li>Event Booking Website</li></b>
			A website where movies, dramas, concerts and other events can easily be found and booked. It provides a very simplistic UI for the user and employs an accurate Transaction Control for databases. The project can be found <a href = "https://github.com/PunitLodha/Movie-ticketing-system" target="blank">here</a>.
			<!-- <li>Virtual ATM</li> -->
<!-- 			A Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) project that provides a dynamic UI. The project can be found <a href = "https://github.com/onkarthorat/Virtual-ATM---Mini-JDBC-Project" target="blank">here</a>. -->

		<h1>Experience
		</h1>
		<ol>
			<b><li>2021 Summer Intern at Oracle Financial Services Software Ltd.</li></b>
			During the 8 weeks summer internship, I majorly worked over API containerization using Kubernetes and Docker. Other tasks completed by me include logging of messages and API requests using Apache Kafka.

			<b><li>Coding Department Mentor at DJS Antariksh, an autonomous rover building team of college (April 2021 - present)</li></b>
			Guiding the juniors in the team to prepare for upcoming global competitions and hackathons related to Mars and autonomous rovers.

			<b><li>Head of Machine Learning and Computer Vision Sub-department at DJS Antariksh</li></b>
			Led the sub-department consisting of four juniors to construct and annotate the dataset, train a Deep Learning model (Yolo) for object detection tasks, and developing Computer Vision algorithms.

			<b><li>Selected and participated in JP Morgan Chase & Co. Code for Good event/hackathon (Aug 2020)</li></b>
			In this virtual hackathon, the selected individuals from all over India were shuffled in random teams. We constructed a prototype of a Learning Management System website where my main role was to handle the database.
