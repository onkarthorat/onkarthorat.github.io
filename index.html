		<h1>Projects
		</h1>
			<h3>Vision Acolyte - BE Major Project (Currently working)</h3>
			While the purpose of this project is to help children with cognitive disabilities grasp and learn better, it is equally useful to others. Have you ever wondered what it might be like to visually view the story you read? Vision Acolyte makes that possible with the use of Deep Learning models such as Transformers and GANs.

			<h3>Hand Gesture Recognition model</h3>
			This project predicts the number of fingers showed by the user in real-time. It applies Transfer Learning using ResNet50 model on a custom made dataset for classification. Various other Computer Vision algorithms are also employed in this project.

			<h3>Autograder - Creating Classification of Models</h3>
			A project completed under the guidance of IBM mentors to ease the work of faculty members. A Deep Learning Model that helps in autograding of the students' answers by comparing it with the base answer. The model also provides a grade on a range of 0-5. Moreover, the model is integrated on a website made using Django as backend.

			<h3>Event Booking Website</h3>
			A website where movies, dramas, concerts and other events can easily be found and booked. It provides a very simplistic UI for the user and employs an accurate Transaction Control for databases.
