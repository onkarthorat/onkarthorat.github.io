							<i>Title</i> - TaxoDaCML: Taxonomy based Divide and Conquer using Machine Learning Approach for DDoS Attack Classification<br>
			<i>Authors</i> - Onkar Thorat, Nirali Parekh, Ramchandra Mangrulkar<br>
			<i>Journal/Conference</i> -  Accepted in the International Journal of Information Management Data Insights, Elsevier
			<br>
		<button type="button" class="collapsible"><i>Abstract</i></button>
		<div class="content">

			<p style="text-align:justify">Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack is one of the most dangerous attacks that result in bringing down the server(s) and it is essential to classify the exact attack to implement robust security measures. In this work, we present an approach for detecting the prominent DDoS attacks that can be carried over Transport Layer protocols. Four different levels are taken into consideration which helps to classify one of the 11 different attacks. A bigger problem is divided into smaller ones and then conquered. This approach, called TaxoDaCML - Taxonomy-based Divide and Conquer approach using ML minimizes computational cost and at the same time maintains the required accuracy. Results prove that our approach achieves 99.9% accuracy for DDoS attack detection and more than 85% for DDoS attack classification. Comparison of TaxoDaCML is done with the previous works and is found to perform better for DDoS attacks classification.</p>

		<button type="button" class="collapsible"><i>Abstract</i></button>
		<div class="content">
			<p style="text-align:justify">With MOOCs becoming an educational buzzword in India and presaging a revolution in education technology; companies such as Coursera, Udemy and EdX, that offer undergraduate-level university courses as alternatives to mainstream education are on the rise across India. The paper tries to impress upon the importance of modulation in content when a multitude of courses and tracks are presented to a user. The finding presents two unique insights, the first being, would a user be it a student or teacher go astray in exploring varied domains available in MOOCs? The second, would student enrollment leaning specifically towards particular courses point to a lacuna in the current course offerings at the university curriculum and could such courses be offered as electives under the mentorship of professors, considering a cluster demand for the same is clearly seen from the learning analytics.</p>

				<i>Title</i> - Combining DNA Sequences and Chaotic Maps to Improve Robustness of RGB Image Encryption<br>
			<i>Authors</i> - Onkar Thorat, Ramchandra Mangrulkar<br>
			<i>Journal/Conference</i> - Accepted in the International Journal of Computational Science and Engineering, Inderscience Publishers
<br>
		<button type="button" class="collapsible"><i>Abstract</i></button>
		<div class="content">
			<p style="text-align:justify">In today's world color images are vastly generated and stored for a variety of purposes by organizations. Standard encryption schemes such as AES or DES are not well suited for encryption of multimedia data due to their pattern appearance and high computational cost. Many methods are being proposed for the encryption of grayscale images. However, there are only a few methods proposed in the literature specifically for encrypting the color images. This paper presents a new method called RGB Image Encryption Scheme (RGBIES) for encrypting the color images based on Chaotic maps and DNA sequences. RGBIES has three major stages. Stages 1 and 3 propose a powerful scrambling algorithm based on a Chaotic Logistic map. The intermediate step uses a Chaotic Lorenz map, the keys of which are obtained using DNA sequences. Various visual and quantitative analyses are performed that prove the resistance of the method against modern-day attacks.</p>

			<i>Title</i> - Domain adaptation and weight initialization of neural networks for diagnosing interstitial lung diseases<br>
			<i>Authors</i> - Onkar Thorat, Siddharth Salvi, Shrey Dedhia, Chetashri Bhadane, Deepika Dongre<br>
			<i>Journal/Conference</i> - Under review in Computer Methods in Biomechanics and Biomedical Engineering: Imaging & Visualization, Taylor & Francis
						<br>
		<button type="button" class="collapsible"><i>Abstract</i></button>
		<div class="content">
			<p style="text-align:justify">Interstitial lung diseases (ILDs) are adverse disorders causing the damaging of lung tissues, thus making timely diagnosis imperative. High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) images provide meticulous lung detail, which aids doctors in the assessment and diagnosis of ILDs. To counter the scarcity of publicly available HRCT data, a robust architecture, employing both HRCT as well as X-Ray images, has been proposed for the classification of ILDs. In the presented supervised domain adaptation architecture, a model is first trained to diagnose three ILD diseases and a healthy lung from X-Ray data and then trained with a comparatively small amount of HRCT data of the same four classes. We also propose an EfficientNet+AlexNet model and a custom deep convolutional neural network and compare their performances by initializing different types of weights at the start of training for X-Ray images. The EfficientNet+AlexNet model initialized with ImageNet weights performed best on the X-Ray dataset and is then used for supervised domain adaptation. The performance of our method is compared to that of a single pre-trained EfficientNetB0 model, which is trained on the same HRCT data. The experimental results and various plots depict the superiority of domain adaptation and the potentials of weights that are used as a starting point for training the models.</p>

			<i>(Transformers, GANs, TensorFlow, PyTorch, spaCy, Python)</i>
			<ul>	
				<li>While the purpose of this project is to help children with cognitive disabilities grasp and learn better, it is equally useful to others. Have you ever wondered what it might be like to visually view the story you read?</li>
				<li>Vision Acolyte makes that possible with the use of Transformers and GANs. User needs to enter a textual story which then gets converted into a video. (Currently, the stories are limited to animated stories for children)</li>
				<li><i>My role - </i>Literature survey, devising the methodolgy, currently implementing and validating it in Python.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Hand Gesture Recognition</h3>
			<i>(Keras with TensorFlow as backend, OpenCV, Python)</i>
			<ul>
			<li>The project aims to predict the five gestures showed by the user in real-time using a 5-layer custom made CNN model.</li>
			<li>We made our own dataset and trained the model on this dataset. </li>
			<li><i>My role - </i>Collected the data using a OpenCV script, created and trained the model.</i>
